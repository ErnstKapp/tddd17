We systematically explore the widely held, anecdotal belief that mismanaged networks are responsible for a wide range of security incidents. Utilizing Internet-scale measurements and global feeds of malicious activities, we show a statistically significant correlation between mismanaged networks and networks that are responsible for malicious behavior on the Internet.

Macaroons are authorization credentials whose efficiency and ease-of-deployment equal that of Web cookies, thanks to their chained-HMAC construction. Unlike cookies, macaroons support efficient, widely-applicable forms of decentralized delegation, with expressiveness that rivals public-key-based mechanisms like SPKI/SDSI. Thus, macaroons can flexibly confine how, by whom, and in what context, authority can be exercised.
