Keynote: On Subverting Trust.
Security research is an exercise in paranoia. But sometimes even we researchers aren’t paranoid enough. In this talk I’ll cover the problem of establishing trust in an environment where trust has been broken — subverted, in some cases by malicious attackers, and in others by governments. I’ll focus primarily on two recent incidents: the 2015 hack of Juniper Networks, which led to serious vulnerabilities in widely-trusted VPN devices; and the recent efforts by governments to obtain “cryptographic backdoors” into end-to-end encryption systems that are increasingly popular on smartphones.
